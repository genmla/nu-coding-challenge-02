          When I needed to defend my interests, they were in English Literature and Early Modern conceptions of birth
          and motherhood. Now, I read a lot of YA fantasy, watch a lot of cartoons, and fret a lot over houseplants. I
          still enjoy Shakespeare's <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>, and Hippocratic texts, and metatheatricality. I also
          enjoy autumn foliage, camping, and playing fiddle.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have a Bachelor's in English Literature from the University of Texas at Austin and a Master's in the
          Humanities from the University of Chicago. People have asked over and over again what I am doing with either
          of those degrees, and man it would be sweet to tell them I am coding.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am the lead communications specialist in the Enrollment Advising department at Northwestern University
          School of Professional Studies. In this communication role, I have gained hands-on experience in HTML and
          CSS. I enrolled in this bootcamp to expand my coding skills, which I endeavor to leverage in my career.
